# Timeless v2
## This project uses a 5V Adafruit Trinket and a few components to create a slow motion picture frame. Code compiles with native arduino libraries.
## For best use, I recommend burning the bootloader for 8Mhz Trinket, and then loading the main application via an Arduino Uno as an ISP.
